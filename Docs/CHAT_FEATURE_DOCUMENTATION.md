# Azul Game Chat Feature Documentation

## Overview

The Azul game now includes a real-time chat feature that allows players to communicate during gameplay. This feature provides seamless messaging between all players in a game session using SignalR WebSocket connections.

## Features

- **Real-time messaging**: Instant message delivery using WebSocket connections
- **Player identification**: Messages display the sender's name and timestamp
- **Collapsible UI**: Chat panel can be hidden/shown without affecting gameplay
- **Message validation**: 500 character limit with input sanitization
- **Visual notifications**: Chat button pulses when new messages arrive while chat is closed
- **System notifications**: Automatic messages for player join/leave events
- **Responsive design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices

## Technical Architecture

### Backend Implementation

**File**: `Backend/Azul.Api/Hubs/GameWebSocketHub.cs`

The chat functionality extends the existing SignalR hub with the following methods:

#### `SendChatMessage(string message, string playerName = null)`
- Handles incoming chat messages from clients
- Validates and sanitizes message content
- Broadcasts messages to all players in the game group
- Automatically extracts game ID from connection context
- Supports player name parameter or fallback to authentication claims

#### `NotifyPlayerJoined(string gameId, string playerName)`
- Sends system notification when a player joins
- Creates styled system messages differentiated from user messages

#### `NotifyPlayerLeft(string gameId, string playerName)`
- Sends system notification when a player leaves
- Maintains chat history for context

**Key Features**:
- Message length validation (500 characters max)
- XSS protection through input sanitization
- Error handling with client feedback
- Game-specific message routing using SignalR groups

### Frontend Implementation

**Files**: 
- `Frontend2/js/chatClient.js` - Chat functionality module
- `Frontend2/game.html` - Chat UI components
- `Frontend2/js/game.js` - Integration with game logic

#### Chat Client Module (`chatClient.js`)

**Core Functions**:
- `initializeChat(wsConnection, playerName)` - Sets up chat with WebSocket connection
- `handleChatMessage(chatMessage)` - Processes incoming messages with extensive debugging
- `sendChatMessage()` - Sends messages to backend with proper parameter handling
- `toggleChat()` - Controls chat panel visibility with smooth animations
- `displayChatMessage(chatMessage)` - Renders messages with proper formatting

**Message Handling**:
- Supports multiple message property formats for robust compatibility
- Timestamp parsing with fallback mechanisms
- Player name extraction with multiple fallback options
- Visual distinction between own messages, other players, and system messages

#### UI Components (`game.html`)

**Chat Panel Structure**:
```html
<!-- Chat Toggle Button -->
<button id="chat-toggle">Game Chat</button>

<!-- Chat Container -->
<div id="chat-container">
    <!-- Messages Area -->
    <div id="chat-messages"></div>
    
    <!-- Input Area -->
    <input id="chat-input" placeholder="Type your message...">
    <button id="chat-send">Send</button>
</div>
```

**Styling Features**:
- Collapsible design with FontAwesome icons
- Smooth animations using CSS transitions
- Responsive layout that adapts to screen size
- Azul game theme integration with branded colors

### Integration with Game Logic

**File**: `Frontend2/js/game.js`

The chat is seamlessly integrated with the existing game infrastructure:

#### `initializeChatIfNeeded()`
- Called when WebSocket connection is established
- Extracts player name from game state
- Initializes chat with proper connection and player context
- Only initializes once per game session

**Integration Points**:
- Chat initialization occurs during `handleWsOpen()`
- Player names sourced from current game state
- Uses existing WebSocket connection infrastructure
- No interference with game functionality

## User Interface

### Chat Panel Features

1. **Toggle Button**: 
   - Always visible "Game Chat" button
   - Shows expand/collapse icons
   - Pulses red when new messages arrive while closed

2. **Messages Area**:
   - Scrollable message history (264px height)
   - Auto-scroll to newest messages
   - Distinctive styling for different message types:
     - Own messages: Blue background, right-aligned
     - Other players: Gray background, left-aligned  
     - System messages: Centered, italic, gray text

3. **Input Area**:
   - Text input with 500 character limit
   - Send button (disabled when input is empty)
   - Enter key support for quick sending
   - Character limit guidance in placeholder text

### Message Display Format

**Regular Messages**:
```
[PlayerName]                    [Timestamp]
Message content here...
```

**System Messages**:
```
[Timestamp] - PlayerName joined the game
```

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

The chat feature is automatically included with the Azul game. No additional setup is required beyond the standard game installation.

### Backend Configuration

The chat functionality uses the existing SignalR hub configuration in `Program.cs`. No additional configuration is needed.

### Frontend Dependencies

- SignalR JavaScript client (already included)
- FontAwesome icons (already included)
- TailwindCSS (already included)

## Usage Instructions

### For Players

1. **Opening Chat**: Click the "Game Chat" button to expand the chat panel
2. **Sending Messages**: 
   - Type your message in the input field
   - Press Enter or click the send button
   - Messages are limited to 500 characters
3. **Closing Chat**: Click the "Game Chat" button again to collapse the panel
4. **Notifications**: The chat button will pulse red when new messages arrive while closed

### For Developers

#### Adding Chat to New Pages

1. Import the chat module:
```javascript
import { initializeChat, isChatInitialized } from './chatClient.js';
```

2. Initialize chat when WebSocket connects:
```javascript
if (wsConnection && playerName) {
    initializeChat(wsConnection, playerName);
}
```

3. Include chat HTML structure in your page template

#### Customizing Chat Behavior

The chat module exports these functions:
- `initializeChat(wsConnection, playerName)` - Initialize chat
- `isChatInitialized()` - Check if chat is active
- `toggleChat()` - Programmatically show/hide chat

## Debugging and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Unknown Player" appearing**: 
   - Ensure player name is passed correctly to `initializeChat()`
   - Check that game state contains player information

2. **Messages not appearing**:
   - Verify WebSocket connection is established
   - Check browser console for SignalR connection errors
   - Ensure backend is running and accessible

3. **Chat panel not responding**:
   - Verify HTML elements have correct IDs (`chat-toggle`, `chat-container`, etc.)
   - Check that `setupChatUI()` is called after DOM is loaded

### Debug Information

The chat client includes extensive debug logging. Enable browser developer tools to see:
- Incoming message structure analysis
- Property extraction attempts
- Timestamp parsing details
- Connection state changes

### Backend Logging

The server logs all chat activities:
```
Chat message from {playerName} in game {gameId}: {message}
```

Check server logs for message delivery confirmation and error details.

## Security Features

1. **Message Sanitization**: All messages are trimmed and length-limited
2. **XSS Protection**: HTML content is escaped before display
3. **Game Isolation**: Messages are only sent to players in the same game
4. **Input Validation**: Empty messages and invalid game sessions are rejected

## Performance Considerations

- **Memory Usage**: Chat history is stored in DOM only (not persisted)
- **Network Efficiency**: Uses existing WebSocket connection
- **UI Performance**: Virtual scrolling not implemented (suitable for typical game session lengths)
- **Message Limits**: 500 character limit prevents excessive data transmission

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- Message persistence and history
- Private messaging between players
- Emoji support and reactions
- Message timestamps with timezone support
- Chat moderation features
- Sound notifications for new messages

## Assignment Value

This chat feature implementation represents **2 points** toward the total assignment score, demonstrating:
- Real-time communication implementation
- SignalR WebSocket integration
- Responsive UI design
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Error handling and user experience considerations
